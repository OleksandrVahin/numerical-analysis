# numerical-analysis
Here I publish my realisations of my university labs

1) Root search - program, which can generate polynomial functions, find roots on segments via bisection, chord and newton methods 
2) SLAE solver - script to solve system of linear algebraic equations using Yakobi method
3) NSE solver - script to solve nonlinear system of equations using simple iterations and Newton methods
4) func_approx - script which helpp with interpolation some function via Lagrange, Newton polynoms, and approximate via smallest squares method
